# Deepwater Plankton Classification

In this project, we explored various neural network archiectures and performed transfer
learning via VGG16, VGG19, and Xception on a deep sea plankton dataset to classify
each subspecies. 

We experimented with different settings, such as classification layers, optimizers,
parameters, etc., to obtain the best results.
